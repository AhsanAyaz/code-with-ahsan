## üìã Starter README

- A Gatsby starter for a minimalist portfolio with `SEO` and app theming using `React Context`, `Bootstrap` and `Sass`
- I highly recommend going through Gatsby's [tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) before getting started.

### What does this starter offer?

- The starter is based off of the official [hello-world](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world) starter provided.
- Everything in the starter is reconfigurable.
- This starter is really a demonstation of what Gatsby is capable of.
- Built in support for `SEO`, light/dark mode and `bootstrap`
- Starter comes with a locally hosted font `Aurebesh`, but feel free to remove/replace it
- Starter uses fontawesome icons for affiliate links
- Starter uses `gatsby-node.js` and Markdown files to programatically create pages for blog posts and projects
- Starter uses `siteMetadata` to create `About` page

### The file structure is as follows:

- **Components**: Re-usable components to be used throughout the app
- **Content**: Contains relevant markdown files and images for blog posts or projects
- **Templates**: Contains files that create the template html for a blog post or project details page
- **Styles**: Contains the sass files used for adding custom styling to the app
- **Utils**: Contains helper files, seo, and theme management
- **Pages**: Contains the different pages
- **Static**: Contains static assets (i.e. self-hosted fonts or images) that bypass gatsby pipeline

### Understanding important dependencies:

- Gatbsy recommends using its plugins whenever possible, but not always. See [documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/plugins/) for more details.
- Gatsby plugins are used by Gatsby's build process and provide and API for certain tasks.
- `Bootstrap` is a CSS framework that comes with already defined CSS classes
- `React Bootstrap` is an abstraction of `Bootstrap` providing some basic styling built-in to its components
- `Helmet` is used to add SEO to the site making it easier for search engines to relate search keywords to your website.
- `Fontawesome` is used for icons
- `Howler` is used to manage audio files

  Gatsby's hello-world starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this hello-world boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing fast app generator for React.

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the hello-world starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the hello-world starter
    gatsby new my-hello-world-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-hello-world-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-hello-world-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## üéì Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
