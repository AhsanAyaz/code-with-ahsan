If you are an üÖ∞Ô∏èngular developer and are always thinking what are the best
practices for this, and that in Angular, this is a book that I've written **JUST

where **Google** acknowledged myself as a
[Google Developers Expert in Angular](https://ahsanayaz.com/gde). And I've
compiled over 80 recipes that **every** Angular developer should know. Be it
**Component Communication, Performance Optimization, Routing Strategies,
Animations,** or even **Progressive Web Apps with Angular**, I've got you
covered with more than **600 pages** of üÖ∞Ô∏èngular goodness! üòé

Just kidding üòÑ. I have spent a lot of time learning lots of techniques with
Angular. For the most part, it's easy peasy. But some things you always learn
**the hard way**. And I'd never want anyone to unnecessarily spent extensive
time to go learning those techniques. The purpose of this book is to make the
process easier for you to become an **Expert** in developing Enterprise
applications with Angular.
