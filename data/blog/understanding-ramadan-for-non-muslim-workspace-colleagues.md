_An informative article to help non-Muslims understand what to expect during the holy month of Ramadan_

---

Ramadan is a special month in the Islamic calendar during which Muslims worldwide observe fasting, prayer, and spiritual reflection.
As our workplaces include colleagues who may not know what to expect from Muslims in Ramadan, this guide aims to provide clarity on their practices and offer understanding and respect during this time.

## 1. Fasting from Dawn to Dusk

**What It Means:**  
During Ramadan, Muslims abstain from food and drink‚Äîfrom the moment of dawn until sunset. This fast is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and is intended to promote self-discipline, empathy for the less fortunate, and spiritual growth. And yes, Muslims don't even drink water while fasting üôÇ Which is a common question asked.

**Scriptural Foundations:**

- **Quran Reference:**
  > 'O you who have believed, fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become righteous.'  
  > ‚Äî _Surah Al-Baqarah (2:183)_
- **Hadith Insight:**

  > Narrated/Authority of Abu Huraira,
  > The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, _'Whoever does not give up forged speech and evil actions, Allah is not in need of his leaving his food and drink (i.e. Allah will not accept his fasting.)'_  
  > ‚Äî _Sahih Bukhari (31:127)_

  This emphasizes that fasting is not only about abstaining from eating and drinking but also about purifying one‚Äôs behavior and speech.

## 2. Regular 5 times Prayers (Salah)

**What to Expect:**  
Muslims pray five times a day as part of their daily spiritual practice. During Ramadan, while this routine remains the same, the devotion to these prayers increases significantly. Many will spend a bit of an extra time in prayer, reflection, and recitation of the Quran.

**Key Points:**

- **Regular Prayers:** Muslims continue to pray five times a day‚Äîat dawn (Fajr), noon (Dhuhr), afternoon (Asr), sunset (Maghrib), and night (Isha).
- **More Time in Worship:** You may notice colleagues stepping away for a few extra minutes beyond their usual prayer times for additional supplications and recitation.
- **Spiritual Focus:** The increased devotion is a personal commitment and a key part of the Ramadan experience.

## 3. Friday Congregational Prayers

**What Happens on Fridays:**  
For Muslims, Friday holds special significance. The weekly congregational prayer (Jumu'ah) is an important communal event, and during Ramadan, attendance might be especially high.

**In the Workplace:**  
You may notice that some colleagues take extra care to observe these prayers on Fridays. This communal aspect strengthens their faith and sense of unity with the Muslim community.

## 4. Taraweeh Prayers

**Evening Congregational Prayers:**  
After the regular night prayer (Isha), Muslims perform special prayers known as Taraweeh. These are usually held in the mosque and involve lengthy recitations of the Quran.

**Workplace Implications:**  
During Taraweeh, some colleagues may not be available for after-work activities or social gatherings. This practice is a cherished part of Ramadan and reflects their commitment to spiritual growth.

## 5. A Time for Spiritual Reflection and Charity

**Daily Routine Changes:**  
Ramadan is much more than fasting; it is a period dedicated to enhancing one‚Äôs spiritual life. Many Muslims spend additional time reading the Quran, engaging in ‚Äúzikr‚Äù (remembrance and praise of Allah), and performing acts of charity. There is often a conscious effort to distance oneself from worldly distractions in order to focus on fulfilling both personal and professional obligations with sincerity and mindfulness.

**Understanding Behavior:**

- **Focused Time:** Expect that some colleagues might prefer quiet time for reflection over participating in non-essential after-work events.
- **Charitable Acts:** There may also be discussions or initiatives related to charity, reflecting the spirit of giving during this month.

## 6. Disclaimer

While it is important to be considerate of Muslim colleagues who are fasting and praying during Ramadan, it is equally important to clarify that from an Islamic perspective, this does not exempt them from fulfilling their work obligations. Fasting and prayers should not be used as a reason to reduce work hours unless explicitly stated in the work contract.

Muslim employees are expected to manage their time effectively, ensuring that any time taken for prayer, including Friday congregation, is made up accordingly. Islam emphasizes fulfilling commitments, including professional responsibilities, with integrity and diligence.

## In Conclusion

Ramadan is a month of deep spiritual significance, marked by fasting, prayer, and reflection. By understanding these practices, non-Muslim colleagues can foster a respectful and supportive environment. Recognizing and appreciating these observances can enhance workplace harmony and cultural sensitivity.

I hope this guide provides you with a clear understanding of what to expect during Ramadan. May this period be one of peace, understanding, and mutual respect for everyone in our diverse community.
