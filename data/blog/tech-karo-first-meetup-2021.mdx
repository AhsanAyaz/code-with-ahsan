Wanted to share my experience of [mentoring at tech karo](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6811285354465894400/) this time in 2021. Which is the first meetup this year. I have already been part of the mentor meetups [before for Tech Karo](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TechKaro%20%40muhd_ahsanayaz&src=typeahead_click) but this was yet another amazing one. If you don't really know about [#techKaro](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TechKaro?src=hashtag_click) yet, do have a quick look at [#techKaro on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TechKaro?src=hashtag_click)

## About TechKaro

Tech Karo is an intitiative by team [CIRCLE](https://twitter.com/CIRCLEwomen_)
and has been in the works for the past 3 years.

Youâ€™ll be amazed to know that in a span of 3 years, they have successfully
graduated **300+ students**. What's amazing is that **75%** of the #TechKaro
alumni are placed and working in different Tech organizations of Pakistan and
earning an average of **Rs. 30k+/month**. With the highest pay of **Rs.
70k+/month**. This is indeed a great achievement in my honest opinion.

This year, they've kicked off their fourth cohort of web development on **22nd
April 2021** with **35 students (65% female)**.

TechKaro has been running a mentorship program for the last three years and a
lot of cool people like [me](https://twitter.com/muhd_ahsanayaz) ðŸ˜„,
[Mashhood](https://twitter.com/mashhoodr),
[Syed Saad](https://twitter.com/SaadQamar96) and others have been involved in
supporting mission! Essentially, you get to meet all the students on a weekend
and you get to mentor 3-5 students directly. Which is an absolute amazing
experience for me. You get to review their projects, highlight potential
improvements and what not. If you're interested in becoming a member, make sure

## My Experience of this Mentor Meetup

This time, the event started at 12:30 PM Pakistan Time. The team introduced the
mentors to the students. And the program to the new mentors. I was assigned
three brilliant students. And looking at their projects and what they've
achieved in such a short period of time with Tech Karo, i was absolutely mind
blowned.

Following are the students I met, and their projects

#### Naima Shaikh:

[Naima](https://twitter.com/NaimaShaykh) created a decent and sleek
[portfolio website](https://naima-shk.github.io/Circle-Web-Development/Module-1-end-Project/)
at the end of the Module 1. The colors were decent and the feedback I gave
included hover transitions on buttons, some layout alignment and some color
contrast tips. Glad to see the suggestions already implemented.

#### Faisal Kalwar:

[Faisal](https://twitter.com/Faisalkalwar8?s=09)'s
[portfolio website](https://faisal-kalwar.github.io/Portfolio-module-end-project/)
used a combination of grey, black and white color. Apart from the positoning of
some elements, it really showed good amount of efforts and practice. All these
students created a single page portfolio websites.

#### Noreen Akhtar:

I found [Noreen](https://twitter.com/NOREENAKHTAR96)'s
[portfolio website](https://noreen-akhtar.github.io/portfolio/) **the best** out
of the three projects ðŸŽ‰. The color combination was well thought of, considering
dark mode. There were almost no alignment issues. I did suggest some tips for
including better contrast in the site. And some tips on the UX of the buttons in
general. The overall design and implementation of the project was well thought
out though

## Conclusion

We all know that the ratio of #womenInTech is pretty low throughout the world.
And in Pakistan, it's even worse. I'm really happy personally that I can
contribute to increment of this ratio and to help these students become better
at what they're doing. Although, my contributions are negligible compared to
what [CIRCLE](https://twitter.com/CIRCLEwomen_) and the team
[#techKaro](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TechKaro) are doing! ðŸ˜„. Please give
them love by tweeting to them, supporting them or by becoming a mentor in the
upcoming mentors! ðŸŽ‰ And as always, happy coding!
