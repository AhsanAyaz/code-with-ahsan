# How to Build Programming Logic

## Introduction

Building programming logic is a challenging but rewarding skill. It can be difficult to know where to start, especially if you're a beginner. But don't worry, I'm here to help. In this article, I'll share 10 tips on how to build programming logic.

## Tips

1. **It's okay to google.** Everyone googles things when they're programming. Even experienced engineers. The important thing is to understand the concepts and be able to apply them to your own code. I can't recall how many times I've googled `"email regex for javascript"`
2. **Break down the problem into smaller steps.** When you're trying to build a complex piece of logic, it can be helpful to break it down into smaller, more manageable steps. This will make it easier to think about and solve the problem.
3. **Use pseudocode.** Pseudocode is a way of writing out your logic without having to worry about the syntax of a particular programming language. This can be a helpful way to get your thoughts down on paper and to debug your logic before you start writing code.
4. **Test your code.** Once you have a working piece of code, it's important to test it to make sure it works correctly. This will help you catch any errors in your logic and make sure your code is reliable.
5. **Don't be afraid to ask for help.** If you're stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help from a more experienced engineer. There are also many online resources available that can help you with your programming logic.
6. **Practice, practice, practice.** The more you practice, the better you'll become at building programming logic. So don't give up! Keep practicing and you'll eventually get the hang of it.
7. **Learn from your mistakes.** Everyone makes mistakes when they're programming. The important thing is to learn from your mistakes and not make the same ones twice.
8. **Don't compare yourself to others.** Everyone learns at their own pace. Don't compare yourself to other engineers, just focus on improving your own skills.
9. **Stay motivated.** Learning to program can be challenging, but it's also a lot of fun. Stay motivated by setting goals for yourself and celebrating your successes along the way.
10. **Have fun!** Programming is a creative and challenging field. So enjoy the process and don't take yourself too seriously.

## Additional tips

- Read books and articles about programming logic.
- Take online courses or tutorials on programming logic.
- Join a coding community or forum where you can ask questions and get help from other programmers.
- Work on personal projects to practice your programming logic skills.
- Participate in coding challenges and hackathons.
- Solve logic puzzles and play logical games.

I hope these tips help you build your programming logic skills. Just remember to be patient, persistent, and have fun!
