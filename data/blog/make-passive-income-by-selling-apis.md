I love helping developers to learn and grow their skills in Angular & Web Development. And while we're all busy ðŸ’»working on our jobs and passion projects, wouldn't it be nice to have a way to earn some Passive Income ðŸ’²ðŸ’² as a Software Engineer?
That's exactly what I help you with within this video.

- âœ… Building a backend API using NodeJS and Express JS
- âœ… Using Rapid API Hub
- âœ… Validating API data/params using JOI
- âœ… Conning to a MongoDB Database
- âœ… Deploying to Heroku
- âœ… Setting up the API on Rapid API Hub to start earning money.
