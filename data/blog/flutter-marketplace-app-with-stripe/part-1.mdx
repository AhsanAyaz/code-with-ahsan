## Stripe account & marketplace configuration

First of all, log into your Stripe account. Once logged in, go to the
[Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard). From the left nav
items, click **View test data** to make sure we're viewing the Dashboard in
**Test Mode** as shown in [Figure 1.1](#figure-1.1). This is important so we can
build the app in Test Mode, and make some test transactions without having to
actually pay anything.

  caption="Figure 1.1"
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

Once done, go to the
[Developers > API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) page to get
your **Publishable key** and your **Secret Key** as shown in
[Figure 1.2](#figure-1.2). You'll need these later in the tutorial.

  alt="Get stripe keys image"
  src="/static/images/flutter-marketplace-app-with-stripe-connect-part-1/get-stripe-keys.png"
  caption="Figure 1.2"
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

Now, go to the
[Stripe Connect Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/applications)
page and fill the **Branding** information according to your business details.
It's great that Stripe provides this configuration so when the user/seller signs
up, the onboarding flow feels natural and consistent with our business's
branding and colors. [Figure 1.3](#figure-1.3) shows how I have configured it
for my test application named **"Panda Gums"**. Make sure to click the **Save
branding changes** button once you're done.

<ImageWithBg
  title="Set branding info"
  alt="Set branding info image"
  src="/static/images/flutter-marketplace-app-with-stripe-connect-part-1/set-branding-info.png"
  caption="Figure 1.3"
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

Now that we have set up the branding information, we need to enable **Express
Checkout** for our country so we can work with test seller accounts created in
our country. In order to do so, scroll above to the **Availability** section on
the same Settings page and click the **Manage** link as shown in
[Figure 1.4](#figure-1.4).

  alt="Manage express accounts availability image"
  src="/static/images/flutter-marketplace-app-with-stripe-connect-part-1/manage-availibility.png"
  caption="Figure 1.4"
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

Now that you are on the
[Express Accounts Settings Page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/applications/express),
check your desired country for which you'll create the seller accounts. Make
sure to enable **Transfers**, **Payments**, and **Cards** capabilities for the
same country as shown in [Figure 1.5](#figure-1.5) and
[Figure 1.6](#figure-1.6). Once done, scroll to the bottom of the page and click
the **Save** button.

## Running the Stripe Backend server locally

Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and
[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed in your system. Then clone the
backend code from the
[repository](https://github.com/AhsanAyaz/stripe-connect-backend) by running the
following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhsanAyaz/stripe-connect-backend.git
```

Once cloned, navigate to the project folder and install the dependencies by
running the command:

```bash
yarn
## OR
npm install
```

Then follow the instructions in the backend project's
[Readme](https://github.com/AhsanAyaz/stripe-connect-backend#readme) file to set
up the Environment variables. Essentially, you need to create the `.env.local`
file in project root and set the following variables:

```
// .env.local
STRIPE_API_SECRET=YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_API_PUBLIC=YOUR_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_SCHEME=pandagums
NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST=http://localhost:3000
STRIPE_APP_FEE=1.23
```

Once done, run the backend server by running the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
## OR
npm run dev
```

This should start the backend server at
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The API routes in the backend
project are avaible at **http://localhost:3000/api/\***. We don't essentially
need to code anything for the backend in this tutorial. Everything is already
set up. The specific API endpoint we're going to use in this article is
`GET http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/account`. And the code for this API
resides
[here in the stripe-connect-backend project](https://github.com/AhsanAyaz/stripe-connect-backend/blob/main/pages/api/stripe/account/index.js).
Let's have a look at it.

```javascript {2,3,8-24}
// pages/api/stripe/account/index.js
const stripe = require("stripe")(process.env.STRIPE_API_SECRET)
const host = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST

const stripeAccount = async (req, res) => {
  const { method } = req
  if (method === "GET") {
    // CREATE CONNECTED ACCOUNT
    const { mobile } = req.query
    const account = await stripe.accounts.create({
      type: "express",
    })
    const accountLinks = await stripe.accountLinks.create({
      account: account.id,
      refresh_url: `${host}/api/stripe/account/reauth?account_id=${account.id}`,
      return_url: `${host}/register${mobile ? "-mobile" : ""}?account_id=${
        account.id
      }&result=success`,
      type: "account_onboarding",
    })
    if (mobile) {
      // In case of request generated from the flutter app, return a json response
      res.status(200).json({ success: true, url: accountLinks.url })
    }
    else {
      // In case of request generated from the web app, redirect
      res.redirect(accountLinks.url)
    }
  }
  else if (method === "DELETE") {...} else if (method === "POST") {...}
}

export default stripeAccount
```

Note that we use the [Stripe NodeJS](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node)
package/sdk to connect with stripe using the `STRIPE_API_SECRET`.

We first create the
[Account object](https://stripe.com/docs/api/accounts/object) using the
`stripe.accounts.create()` method. Then we create the
[Account Link](https://stripe.com/docs/api/account_links) object using the
`stripe.accountLinks.create()` method. Note that we provide the `account_id`
from Account Object, the `refresh_url`, the `type` set to
`'account_onboarding'`, and the `return_url` to this method. And we then return
the `url` received with the Account Link object back to the Flutter app. More on
this in a
[later section](#understanding-seller-registration-via-stripe-connect-onboarding).

## Getting started with the Flutter marketplace app

Run the following commands to clone the project from the
[repository](https://github.com/AhsanAyaz/flutter-stripe-connect) and to
checkout the `start-here` branch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhsanAyaz/flutter-stripe-connect

git checkout start-here
```

Assuming you already have set up Flutter in your machine, open the project in
Android Studio or your favorite editor. Install the dependencies of the Flutter
project by running the following command in your project:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Now run the project your Android Emulator or AVD. Once done successfully, you
should be able to see the app running as shown in [Figure 1.7](#figure-1.7).

<ImageWithBg
  title="App start state"
  alt="App start state image"
  src="/static/images/flutter-marketplace-app-with-stripe-connect-part-1/app-start-state.png"
  caption="Figure 1.7"
  imageHeight="500"
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

As you can see in [Figure 1.7](#figure-1.7), we have a marketplace app named
**Panda Gums**. There will be Merchants/Sellers registered within this
marketplace. And there will be Customers paying for products from these sellers.
In this part, we'll only focus on registering Sellers/Merchants in the app.

<div id="understanding-seller-registration-via-stripe-connect-onboarding" />

## Understanding Seller Registration via Stripe Connect Onboarding

The Seller registration flow includes a couple of things as shown in
[Figure 1.8](#figure-1.8).

<ImageWithBg
  title="Sellers onboarding flow"
  alt="Sellers onboarding flow image"
  src="/static/images/flutter-marketplace-app-with-stripe-connect-part-1/stripe-connect-onboarding-flow.jpg"
  caption="Figure 1.8"
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

Essentially, the steps are as follows:

1. Our Flutter app sends a request to our NodeJS Backend API
2. The NodeJS backend receives the request and uses the
   [Stripe NodeJS SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node) to create a Stripe
   Account for the Seller. In return, the backend receives the
   [Account object](https://stripe.com/docs/api/accounts/object).
3. The backend then uses the ID from the Seller's Account object to create an
   [Account Link](https://stripe.com/docs/api/account_links) using the Stripe
   SDK. This Account Link grants the Seller's account to access the
   Stripe-hosted Connect Onboarding later. In response of the Account Link
   creation, we receive the
   [Account Link object](https://stripe.com/docs/api/account_links/object) from
   Stripe.
4. We use the `url` property from the
   [Account Link object](https://stripe.com/docs/api/account_links/object)
   received, and send it back to the Flutter app.
5. The Flutter app opens the
   [Account Link URL](https://stripe.com/docs/api/account_links/object#account_link_object-url)
   into the mobile's browser using the
   [url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher) flutter package.
6. In the Browser, we go through the entire Stripe Connect Onboarding flow. And
   Stripe provides a great way of using Test Data when we're working in the Test
   mode.
7. Finally, when the seller has entered all the required information and has
   completed the onboarding flow, we land on the
   [return_url](https://stripe.com/docs/api/account_links/create#create_account_link-return_url).
   Which is configured in our
   [NodeJS Backend](https://github.com/AhsanAyaz/stripe-connect-backend/blob/main/pages/api/stripe/account/index.js#L14)
   for when we create the Account Link. And that's basically a web page served
   by our backend itself.
8. The web page we land on in Step 7 contains a button that says **Continue in
   App**. We click it and that deep links into our Flutter app to open a new app
   page containing the success message.

## Let's write some Code, Yeah?

### Seller registration flow

Now that we understand how the Seller's Registration flow works, let's jump into
the code. We'll begin with creating a Service in our Flutter application to
communicate with the NodeJS backend.

In the Flutter app project, create a new folder inside the `lib` folder named
`services`. If you're using Android Studio, you can right click on the `lib`
folder, hover on the option `New`, and click on `Package` to create the folder.
Inside the folder, create a file named `stripe-backend-service.dart` and add the
following code:

```dart
// lib/services/stripe-backend-service.dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

import '../constants.dart';

class CreateAccountResponse {
  late String url;
  late bool success;

  CreateAccountResponse(String url, bool success) {
    this.url = url;
    this.success = success;
  }
}

class CheckoutSessionResponse {
  late Map<String, dynamic> session;

  CheckoutSessionResponse(Map<String, dynamic> session) {
    this.session = session;
  }
}

class StripeBackendService {
  static String apiBase = '$BACKEND_HOST/api/stripe';
  static String createAccountUrl =
      '${StripeBackendService.apiBase}/account?mobile=true';
  static Map<String, String> headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'};

  static Future<CreateAccountResponse> createSellerAccount() async {
    var url = Uri.parse(StripeBackendService.createAccountUrl);
    var response = await http.get(url, headers: StripeBackendService.headers);
    Map<String, dynamic> body = jsonDecode(response.body);
    return new CreateAccountResponse(body['url'], true);
  }
}
```

#### Installing and configuring url_launcher

Install the [url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher) package in the
flutter app project by running the following command in the project root:

```bash
flutter pub add url_launcher
## Based on your editor, you might also want to run `flutter pub get`
```

Now open the file `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and update to add
the `<queries>` object as follows:

```xml {4-17}
// android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.flutter_stripe_connect">
    <queries>
        <intent>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
            <data android:scheme="https" />
        </intent>
        <intent>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
            <data android:scheme="http" />
        </intent>
        <intent>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
            <data android:scheme="pandagums" />
        </intent>
    </queries>
   <application
        android:label="flutter_stripe_connect"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

This makes sure that our Flutter app can open `http://`, `https://` and
`pandagums://` links in the browser using the
[url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher) package. The
[Account Link object](https://stripe.com/docs/api/account_links/object) that we
receive from Stripe has the `https://` scheme. Therefore, this step is
important.

> Note: After the above change, the app needs a full restart. Restart the app
> before proceeding with further steps.

#### Using the url_launcher package to open Account Link URL

Open the file `lib/pages/register.dart` and modify it as follows:

```dart {5,6,30-33}
// lib/pages/register.dart
import 'dart:developer';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sn_progress_dialog/progress_dialog.dart';
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';
import 'package:flutter_stripe_connect/services/stripe-backend-service.dart';

class RegisterSeller extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RegisterSellerState createState() => _RegisterSellerState();
}

class _RegisterSellerState extends State<RegisterSeller> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Register as Seller"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            ProgressDialog pd = ProgressDialog(context: context);
            pd.show(
              max: 100,
              msg: 'Please wait...',
              progressBgColor: Colors.transparent,
            );
            try {
              CreateAccountResponse response = await StripeBackendService.createSellerAccount();
              pd.close();
              await canLaunch(response.url) ? await launch(response.url) : throw 'Could not launch URL';
            } catch (e) {
              log(e.toString());
              pd.close();
            }
          },
          child: Text('Register with Stripe'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

The preceding change ultimately results in calling our Backend API and recieving
the Account Link URL. Notice that we call the methods `canLaunch()` and
`launch()` from the `url_launcher` package. And we provide `response.url` to
these methods to identify if our app can open the link in the browser .

If you go to the
[Connected Accounts page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/connect/accounts/overview)
in the Stripe dashboard, you'll see that there are currently no connected
accounts as shown in [Figure 1.9](#figure-1.9).

<ImageWithBg
  title="No Connected Accounts"
  alt="No Connected Accounts image"
  src="/static/images/flutter-marketplace-app-with-stripe-connect-part-1/no-connected-accounts.png"
  caption="Figure 1.9"
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

Now open the Flutter app and go to the Registration page by tapping the
**Register as Seller** card from the home page. Then tap the **Register with
Stripe** button. Ideally, it should open the Stripe Connect Onboarding flow in
the mobile's browser as shown in [Figure 1.10](#figure-1.10).

<ImageWithBg

  imageHeight="500"
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

> Note: You might encounter the following `SocketException` error when working
> with Android:
>
> ```
> SocketException: OS Error: Connection refused, errno = 111, address = localhost, port = 43248
> ```
>
> What you need to do is expose the port `3000` to the Android emulator by using
> the following command:
>
> ```bash
> adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000
> ```

Once you have the Onboarding flow opened in the Browser, tap the **the test
phone number** link there to use the Stripe-provided test phone number. Then
enter your Stripe email (the real one) for the Stripe account you're using right
now.

> Note: We need the **real email** for this step as Stripe will ask you to log
> into your account for this step.

Once you've successfully logged in, Stripe will redirect you back to the
Onboarding flow. Use the Test code and test data provided by Stripe in all the
following steps. Make sure the **Country** you select is the one we enabled
Payments for in the initial Stripe configuration step.

Fill all the values (dummy values) i.e. the name, birth date, address in the
form as shown in [Figure 1.11](#figure-1.11). Also, select the **Industry** and
write a dummy **Business Website** when prompted.

<ImageWithBg

  src="/static/images/flutter-marketplace-app-with-stripe-connect-part-1/dummy-form-values.png"
  imageHeight="500"
  caption="Figure 1.11"
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

Use the **test account** when asked for Bank Details. And finally, review the
information and hit the **Submit** button. You should be redirected to a
[web page](http://localhost:3000/register-mobile?result=success) served by our
backend as shown in [Figure 1.12](#figure-1.12). Notice that we have a button
with text **Continue in App**. Ideally, pressing this button should open up the
app and show us a new page with success message. However, that's not the case
since we haven't implemented
[Deep linking](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/navigation/deep-linking)
yet.

  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

Even though we're not finished yet with the tutorial, we have made some great
progress. If you go to the
[Connected Accounts](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/connect/accounts/overview)
page now, you should be able to see the newly registered connected account.
Click on it and you should see the account details as shown in
[Figure 1.13](#figure-1.13)

And that is it for this article. See the next section to summarize what we've
learnt today.

## Conclusion

In this article, you learnt how to configure Stripe Connect in the Stripe
Dashboard. And you learnt how to use http calls in our Flutter App, via our
backend to create Connected Accounts for Sellers in Stripe. Ultimately, we are
able to create Connected Accounts. And they can receive payments. However, in
terms of user-experience for the Seller registration, our tutorial isn't
finished yet. And we'll continue with it in the next part. Stay tuned, and as
always, Happy Coding 🙌🏼!
