  In <a href="./part-1">Part 1</a> of the series, we learnt about how to configure Payments using
  Stripe Connect for the marketplace app <strong>Panda Gums</strong> built with Flutter. And we
  implemented the initial steps of the Seller Onboarding flow. In this article, you'll learn how to
  implement <strong>Deep Links</strong> into the <strong>Panda Gums</strong>
  app. You'll also learn how we'll use <strong>Stripe Checkout</strong> to pay for products as customers
  in the Flutter app. The code repositories for this tutorial are as follows:&nbsp;

## Getting Started

> Note: If you haven't followed
> [Part 1](/flutter-marketplace-app-with-stripe-connect-part-1) of this series,
> please follow it before proceeding. I.e. make sure you have the Flutter app
> and the Backend code checked out and ready

For this part, checkout the `part-2` branch by running the following command
from the flutter application root:

```bash
git checkout part-2
```

Then run the
[local backend server](https://github.com/AhsanAyaz/stripe-connect-backend) by
navigating to the server project, and running the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
## OR
npm run dev
```

Now run the Flutter application in an Android emulator. Once done, make sure
we're exposing the port `3000` to the device by running the following command in
terminal:

```bash
adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000
```

## Implementing Deep Links in the Flutter app

To be able to get back in the app from the Seller Onboarding Flow, we need to
implement Deep Links in the Flutter app. You can read more about them in the
[Flutter Deep Linking](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/navigation/deep-linking)
docs. To keep this tutorial short, we're going to implement a **Custom URL
Scheme** for our Flutter app. This scheme is `pandagums://` and we use it when
clicking the **Continue to App** button on the
[Connect Onboarding redirect page](http://localhost:3000/register-mobile?result=success).
As shown in
[Figure 1.12](/flutter-marketplace-app-with-stripe-connect-part-1/#figure-1.12).

To enable deep links in the Flutter app, open the file
`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and update it as follows:

```dart {8,22-28}
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.flutter_stripe_connect">
    <queries>
        ...
    </queries>
   <application
        android:label="flutter_stripe_connect"
        android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            android:launchMode="singleTop"
            android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme"
            android:configChanges="orientation|keyboardHidden|keyboard|screenSize|smallestScreenSize|locale|layoutDirection|fontScale|screenLayout|density|uiMode"
            android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
            android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
            ...
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
            </intent-filter>
            <meta-data android:name="flutter_deeplinking_enabled" android:value="true" />
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
                <data android:scheme="pandagums" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

> Note: After the above change, the app needs a full restart. Restart the app
> before proceeding with further steps.

Once you have run the application, test the Deep Link. Open the browser (Chrome)
in the emulator, then navigate to
[http://localhost:3000/register-mobile?result=success](http://localhost:3000/register-mobile?result=success)
and tap the **Continue in App** button as shown in [Figure 2.1](#figure-2.1)

  imageHeight="500"
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

Wohoo ðŸŽ‰ ! We just got the Deep links working in a single step. However, we just
did a test run. We still don't have a complete Seller Onboarding flow that the
user can follow seamlessly.

## Implementing the Registration Success page in the App

When the Seller has successfully completed the onboarding, we will deep link
into a new page within the Flutter app. Let's call it the **Register Success
Page**. We'll need to create this page first. Let's create a new file inside the
`lib/pages` folder named `register-success.dart` and add all of the the
following code in it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_stripe_connect/app-state.dart';
import 'package:flutter_stripe_connect/router/pages_config.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';

class RegisterSuccessPage extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _RegisterSellerState createState() => _RegisterSellerState();
}

class _RegisterSellerState extends State<RegisterSuccessPage> {

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    PageConfiguration routeArgs = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as PageConfiguration;
    Map<String, dynamic> extras = routeArgs.extras as Map<String, dynamic>;
    final appState = Provider.of<AppState>(context, listen: false);
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
      appState.accountId = extras['account_id'];
    });
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Register as Seller"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Text('Registration Successful'),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

Notice the following lines in the code we just added:

```dart {6-11}
...
class _RegisterSellerState extends State<RegisterSuccessPage> {
  ...
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    PageConfiguration routeArgs = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as PageConfiguration;
    Map<String, dynamic> extras = routeArgs.extras as Map<String, dynamic>;
    final appState = Provider.of<AppState>(context, listen: false);
    Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () {
      appState.accountId = extras['account_id'];
    });
    return Scaffold(...);
  }
}
```

The page assumes that we'll receive some route arguments when this page is
pushed into the routes stack. The specific argument we're interested in is
`account_id`. We extract the route arguments using
`ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments`, then we use `routeArgs.extras` to
extract our custom `extras` parameter (more on this later) in the
[next section](#configuring-the-deep-link-for-the-registration-success-page).
And then we take out the value of the `account_id` property and assign it to the
`appState.accountId` property. Saving this in the App State is essential because
we use this `accountId` property in the customer page when paying for the
products. Essentially, this saved `accountId` is the Seller's **Connected
Account ID**. When we tap the **Continue in App button** in the Browser from the
[http://localhost:3000/register-mobile](http://localhost:3000/register-mobile)
page, it deeplinks into the **Register Success page**, passing the `account_id`
along with the deep link.

## Configuring the Deep Link for the Registration Success page

### Installing the uni_links package

The first thing we need to do is to install the
[uni_links](https://pub.dev/packages/uni_links) package. Follow their official
documentation for installing it.

Once the package is installed, make sure to restart the flutter application.
Then open the file `lib/main.dart` and add the following code to listen to the
deep links:

```dart {1,4,12,19,24,28-39}
import 'dart:async';
...
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
import 'package:uni_links/uni_links.dart';
...
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  final appState = AppState();
  late AppRouterDelegate delegate;
  final parser = AppRouteParser();
  late AppBackButtonDispatcher backButtonDispatcher;

  late StreamSubscription _linkSubscription;

  _MyAppState() {...}

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initPlatformState();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _linkSubscription.cancel();
    super.dispose();
  }

  // Platform messages are asynchronous, so we initialize in an async method.
  Future<void> initPlatformState() async {
    // Attach a listener to the Uri links stream
    _linkSubscription = uriLinkStream.listen((Uri? uri) {
      if (!mounted) return;
      setState(() {
        delegate.parseRoute(uri!);
      });
    }, onError: (Object err) {
      print('Got error $err');
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ChangeNotifierProvider<AppState>(...);
  }
}

```

Now that we are listening to the deep links, let's configure our deep link route
in the next section

### Configuring the deep link route

There are a few pieces we have to add here since we're using
[Flutter's new navigation & routing system](https://medium.com/flutter/learning-flutters-new-navigation-and-routing-system-7c9068155ade)
in this app. First, we need to add a configuration for this page. To do so, open
the file `lib/router/pages_config.dart` and add some code as follows:

```dart {6,8,25-28}
import '../app-state.dart';

const String RegisterPath = '/register';
const String PayOutPath = '/pay-out';
const String HomePath = '/home';
const String RegisterSuccessPath = '/register-success';

enum Pages { Register, PayOut, Home, RegisterSuccess, PayOutSuccess }

class PageConfiguration {...}

PageConfiguration registerPageConfig = PageConfiguration(
    key: 'Register',
    path: RegisterPath,
    uiPage: Pages.Register,
    currentPageAction: null);
PageConfiguration payOutPageConfig = PageConfiguration(
    key: 'PayOut',
    path: PayOutPath,
    uiPage: Pages.PayOut,
    currentPageAction: null);
PageConfiguration homePageConfig = PageConfiguration(
  key: 'Home', path: HomePath, uiPage: Pages.Home, currentPageAction: null
);
PageConfiguration registerSuccessPageConfig = PageConfiguration(
  key: 'RegisterSuccess', path: RegisterSuccessPath,
  uiPage: Pages.RegisterSuccess,currentPageAction: null
);
```

Now open the file `lib/router/routes_parser.dart` and add the code as follows:

```dart {11,12,27,28}
...
class AppRouteParser extends RouteInformationParser<PageConfiguration> {
  @override
  Future<PageConfiguration> parseRouteInformation(RouteInformation routeInformation) async {
    ...
    switch (path) {
      case RegisterPath:
        return registerPageConfig;
      case PayOutPath:
        return payOutPageConfig;
      case RegisterSuccessPath:
        return registerSuccessPageConfig;
      default:
        return homePageConfig;
    }
  }

  @override
  RouteInformation restoreRouteInformation(PageConfiguration configuration) {
    switch (configuration.uiPage) {
      case Pages.Register:
        return const RouteInformation(location: RegisterPath);
      case Pages.PayOut:
        return const RouteInformation(location: PayOutPath);
      case Pages.Home:
        return const RouteInformation(location: HomePath);
      case Pages.RegisterSuccess:
        return const RouteInformation(location: RegisterSuccessPath);
      default: return const RouteInformation(location: HomePath);
    }
  }
}
```

Once done, open the file `lib/router/router_delegate.dart` and update the
`parseRoute` method as follows:

```dart {3,17-25}
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
...
import 'package:flutter_stripe_connect/pages/register-success.dart';
...
class AppRouterDelegate extends RouterDelegate<PageConfiguration>
  with ChangeNotifier, PopNavigatorRouterDelegateMixin<PageConfiguration> {
  ...
  void parseRoute(Uri uri) {
    ...
    if (uri.pathSegments.length == 1) {
      final path = uri.pathSegments[0];
      switch (path) {
        ...
        case 'pay-out':
          push(payOutPageConfig);
          break;
        case 'register-success':
          registerSuccessPageConfig.extras = new Map<String, dynamic>();
          registerSuccessPageConfig.extras['account_id'] = uri.queryParameters['account_id'];
          _pages.add(MaterialPage(
              child: RegisterSuccessPage(),
              key: ValueKey(registerSuccessPageConfig.key),
              name: registerSuccessPageConfig.path,
              arguments: registerSuccessPageConfig));
          break;
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Finally, update the file `lib/app-state.dart` by adding the code as follows:

```dart {9-12}
...
class AppState extends ChangeNotifier {
  ...
  void goToRegister() {
    _currentAction = PageAction(state: PageState.addPage, page: registerPageConfig);
    notifyListeners();
  }

  void goToRegisterSuccess() {
    _currentAction = PageAction(state: PageState.addPage, page: registerSuccessPageConfig);
    notifyListeners();
  }
  ...
}
```

Now that we have set up the routing for the Register Success deep link, let's
test it out in the next section.

## Testing the Register Success page deep link

To test the deep link to the Register Success page, use the terminal to run the
following command:

```bash
adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -c android.intent.category.BROWSABLE -d "pandagums://deeplinks/register-success?account_id=test_deeplink1234"
```

Once you run the above command, you should see the deep link working as shown in
[Figure 2.2](#figure-2.2). You'll also notice that the `accountId` in the
**Customer page** also gets updated with the ID we've provided in the deep link
test. I.e. `test_deeplink_1234`

<ImageWithBg
  title="Deep link register success"
  alt="Deep link register success"
  src="/static/images/flutter-marketplace-app-with-stripe-connect-part-2/deep-link-register-success.gif"
  caption="Figure 2.2"
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

You can play around by providing different account IDs via the **adb shell**
command, and it will always reflect the latest provided id in the Customer view.
In fact, we'll use our already created account's ID next time using the command
when we have to pay for products.

Also, if you want, you can follow a full seller onboarding flow now. You should
be able to see the deep link working. And the newly created account's ID
appearing in the customer page in the end.

## Paying for the Seller products as a Customer

To pay for the customer, the app requires a valid `accountId` to be set in the
App State. In order to work with an existing Seller account, go to your Stripe
Dashboard. Navigate to Connected Accounts. Make sure that you have Test Mode
enabled. And then copy an existing Account ID as shown in
[Figure 2.3](#figure-2.3)

<ImageWithBg
  title="Copy existing Seller account ID"
  alt="Copy existing Seller account ID"
  src="/static/images/flutter-marketplace-app-with-stripe-connect-part-2/copy-account-id.png"
  caption="Figure 2.3"
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

Notice that in [Figure 2.3](#figure-2.3), we have **SEK 0.00** as the **Total
balance** for this seller. This is because no one has bought any products from
this seller. By the end of this tutorial, this seller should have some money in
the bag. ðŸ’°

Making sure that the app is running, open your terminal and type the following
adb shell command replacing `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID` with the account ID you copied:

```bash
adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -c android.intent.category.BROWSABLE -d "pandagums://deeplinks/register-success?account_id=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"
```

> Note: You might have to run this command again if you close the emulator, or
> even if you do a Hot Restart of the app. Because the value of `accountId` is
> lost in that case from the App State.

Now that we have the `accountId` set in the App State, we can do something about
paying for the products as a customer.

### How to pay for a product? Really!

In order to pay for a particular product, we will use
[Checkout](https://stripe.com/en-se/payments/checkout), a Stripe-hosted page to
accept payments for one-time purchases and subscriptions.
[Figure 2.4](#figure-2.4) shows how the entire Payment flow looks like

<ImageWithBg
  title="Payment flow"
  alt="Payment flow image"
  src="/static/images/flutter-marketplace-app-with-stripe-connect-part-2/payment-flow.jpg"
  caption="Figure 2.4"
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

Essentially, these are the steps of the flow:

1. From the Flutter app, we trigger the API call
   `GET http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/checkout-session`
2. The backend uses the Stripe Node.js SDK to call the
   [Create Stripe Checkout Sessions API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create).
   As a response, we get back a
   [checkout session object](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/object).
3. The backend sends the
   [checkout session object](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/object)
   back to the Flutter app.
4. The Flutter app opens the Checkout page `(CheckoutPage)` which just a Flutter
   page (a `MaterialPageRoute`) within the app. We pass the session ID as an
   argument to the page's constructor so it can use it later on.
5. In the Checkout Page, we use the `WebView` widget from the
   [webview_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter/) package to open
   a webview with a pre-defined HTML page containing the Stripe Web (Javascript)
   SDK.
6. We invoke the the Stripe Web SDK's `redirectToCheckout()` within the WebView
   programmatically by passing the Session ID. This triggers a redirect in the
   WebView to the Stripe-hosted checkout page where the Customer can pay for the
   product(s).
7. Once the payment is finished, Stripe redirects the Customer to either the
   `success_url` or the `cancel_url` that we configure in the backend while
   creating the Checkout Session.
8. Based on the redirect in Step 7, the WebView is closed automatically and we
   show a toast message within the Flutter app based on the result.

### Installing the webview_flutter package

Since our flow requires open a WebView as shown in [Figure 2.4](#figure-2.4), we
need to install the [webview_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter/)
package. From the project root, run the following command in your terminal to do
so:

```bash
flutter pub add webview_flutter
```

> Note: After the above change, the app needs a full restart. Restart the app
> before proceeding with further steps.

### Understanding the Backend API to create a session

To understand how we create a session using the Stripe Node.js SDK, have a look
at the following code:

```javascript
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_API_SECRET)
const host = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST
const appFee = process.env.STRIPE_APP_FEE

/**
 * Generates a checkout session based on the Connected Account Id and other
 * data provided. Handles cases for both the flutter app and the web.
 */
const checkoutSession = async (req, res) => {
  const { account_id: accountId, amount, title, currency = 'eur', quantity, mobile } = req.query
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    payment_method_types: ['card'],
    line_items: [
      {
        name: title,
        /**
         * Multiplying by 100 because otherwise for example,
         * 149 becomes 1.49 on Stripe
         */
        amount: Math.round(amount) * 100,
        currency,
        quantity,
      },
    ],
    payment_intent_data: {
      /**
       * Multiplying by 100 because otherwise for example,
       * 149 becomes 1.49 on Stripe
       */
      application_fee_amount: appFee * 100,
      transfer_data: {
        destination: accountId,
      },
    },
    mode: 'payment',
    success_url: `${host}/pay-out${mobile ? '-mobile' : ''}?result=success`,
    cancel_url: `${host}/pay-out${mobile ? '-mobile' : ''}?result=failure`,
  })
  res.status(200).json({ session })
}

export default checkoutSession
```

A few things to note here. First, the API expects to receive the parameters
`account_id`, `amount`, `title`, `currency`, `quantity`, and `mobile`. Although
the parameters `currency` and `mobile` are optional, for this tutorial, they are
still going to be provided from the Flutter app.

Notice that we use the `stripe.checkout.sessions.create()` method to create a
session. And we pass all the required arguments in the method. The
`payment_method_types` is set to `['card']` so the Customer lands on a page that
supports card payments. The`line_items`property is an array that contains
details for each product the customer is paying for. And in
the`payment_intent_data`object, we provide the`application_fee_amount`, which is
the commission the marketplace will get on this transaction, and
the`transfer_data`object which specifies the seller's account ID as
the`destination`. This tells Stripe where to transfer the amount from this
payment.

And finally, we provide the `success_url` and the `cancel_url` to which Stripe
redirects the Customer when the Payment is finished, or cancelled respectively.
Notice that similar to the Seller onboarding, these URLs are web pages in our
local backend. And for the Flutter app, they result in being
`http://localhost:3000/payout-mobile?result=RESULT`

Now that we know about the backend part, let's start writing some code in the
Flutter app as well.

### Updating the `StripeBackendService` to create Checkout Sessions

Open the file `lib/services/stripe-backend-service.dart` and update it as
follows:

```dart {2,8,9,12-21}
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:flutter_stripe_connect/pages/pay-out.dart';
...
class StripeBackendService {
  static String apiBase = '$BACKEND_HOST/api/stripe';
  static String createAccountUrl =
      '${StripeBackendService.apiBase}/account?mobile=true';
  static String checkoutSessionUrl =
      '${StripeBackendService.apiBase}/checkout-session?mobile=true';
  static Map<String, String> headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'};
  ...
  static Future<CheckoutSessionResponse> payForProduct(
      Product product, String accountId) async {
    var url = StripeBackendService.checkoutSessionUrl +
        "&account_id=$accountId&amount=${product.price}&title=${product.title}&quantity=1&currency=${product.currency}";
    Uri parsedUrl = Uri.parse(url);
    var response =
    await http.get(parsedUrl, headers: StripeBackendService.headers);
    Map<String, dynamic> body = jsonDecode(response.body);
    return new CheckoutSessionResponse(body['session']);
  }
}

```

### Creating the CheckoutPage material route

Now we'll create a new page called the `CheckoutPage`. Create a new file under
the `lib/pages` folder named `checkout.dart` and add the following code:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:webview_flutter/webview_flutter.dart';
import '../constants.dart';

String checkoutSuccessUrl = '$BACKEND_HOST/pay-out-mobile?result=success';
String checkoutFailureUrl = '$BACKEND_HOST/pay-out-mobile?result=failure';
String stripePublicKey = 'pk_test_EYFzViclTJlQjgVjGSA4ND7k00wUh0e1tK';

```

<div id="checkout-code-explanation"></div>

We're doing two important things in the above code snippet, specifically in the
`WebView` widget:

1. When the page finishes loading, notice that in the `onPageFinished` callback,
   we check if the `url` is similar to the `initialUrl`. Which means we've
   loaded our hard-coded HTML page from the variable `stripeHtmlPageScaffold`.
   In this case, we run the `_redirectToStripe()` method. Which results in
   redirecting the Customer to the Stripe-hosted Checkout page. Essentially,
   we're executing the Javascript from the `redirectToCheckoutJs` variable.
2. Inside the `navigationDelegate` method, we monitor each navigation using the
   `NavigationRequest` argument. We check the `url` of the NavigationRequest and
   if contains the `checkoutSuccessUrl` or the `checkoutFailureUrl`. Based on
   these conditions, we go back to the previous page using
   `Navigation.of(context).pop()`. And we pass either `success` or `cancel` as a
   parameter back to the previous (`PayOut`) page based on the url matched.

### Update the PayOut page to use the CheckoutPage

Now that we have the `CheckoutPage` created, let's use it in the `PayOut` page
when the Customer tries to pay for a product. Open the file
`lib/pages/pay-out.dart` and update as follows:

```dart {3,4,35-58}
import 'dart:developer';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_stripe_connect/pages/checkout.dart';
import 'package:flutter_stripe_connect/services/stripe-backend-service.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
import 'package:sn_progress_dialog/progress_dialog.dart';
import '../app-state.dart';
...
  List<InkWell> _buildCard(int count) => List.generate(count, (i) {
    final appState = Provider.of<AppState>(context, listen: false);
    String accountId = appState.accountId;
    return InkWell(
      child: Card(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            ...
            ButtonBar(
              children: <Widget>[
                ElevatedButton(
                  style: ButtonStyle(backgroundColor: MaterialStateProperty.all(
                    Theme.of(context).accentColor
                  )),
                  child: const Text('Pay with Stripe'),
                  onPressed: () async {
                    ProgressDialog pd = ProgressDialog(context: context);
                    pd.show(
                      max: 100,
                      msg: 'Please wait...',
                      progressBgColor: Colors.transparent,
                    );
                    try {
                      CheckoutSessionResponse response = await StripeBackendService.payForProduct(products[i], accountId);
                      pd.close();
                      String sessionId = response.session['id'];
                      Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 300), () {
                        Navigator.of(context).push(MaterialPageRoute(
                          builder: (_) => CheckoutPage(sessionId: sessionId),
                        ))
                            .then((value) {
                          if (value == 'success') {
                            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                                new SnackBar(
                                  content: Text('Payment Successful'),
                                  backgroundColor: Colors.green,
                                )
                            );
                          } else if (value == 'cancel') {
                            ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                                new SnackBar(
                                  content: Text('Payment Failed or Cancelled'),
                                  backgroundColor: Colors.red
                                )
                            );
                          }
                        });
                      });
                    } catch (e) {
                      log(e.toString());
                      pd.close();
                    }
                  },
                ),
              ],
            )
          ],
        )));
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {...}
}

```

Notice that in the highlighted code snippet above, we're doing the following:

1. When we tap the **Pay with Stripe** button, we first use the
   `StripeBackendService.payForProduct()` method by passing the current product,
   i.e `product[i]` and the `accountId` which is the Seller's Account ID.
2. Then we extract out the `id` from the `CheckoutSessionResponse` received and
   assign it to the `sessionId` variable.
3. Then we use a `Future.delayed()` just to wait for the progress dialog to
   hide. Otherwise it causes some UI issues.
4. Inside the `Future.delayed()` callback, we create a new `MaterialPageRoute`
   using the `CheckoutPage` widget.
5. We use the `.then()` chainable method to listen for the `CheckoutPage` to be
   closed or popped. And we receive either `success` or `cancel` as a parameter
   as explained in the [details section](#checkout-code-explanation) for the
   `CheckoutPage`.
6. Based on the parameter received, we show either the success SnackBar, or the
   failure SnackBar.

### Testing payments as a Customer

First, make sure you have the app in a fresh state. I.e. either do a full
restart, or a hot-restart. Then set the seller account ID in the app by running
the following command replacing `ACCOUNT_ID` with an account ID from your stripe
dashboard:

```bash
adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -c android.intent.category.BROWSABLE -d "pandagums://deeplinks/register-success?account_id=ACCOUNT_ID"
```

This should bring up the **Register Success** Deep link page in the app. Press
the back button and then verify the account ID by going to the **Pay as a
Customer** page. You should be able to see it as shown in
[Figure 2.2](#figure-2.2), but with your Seller's account ID.

Now press the **Pay with Stripe** button on any of the products. And you should
see the Stripe Checkout page as shown in [Figure 2.5](#figure-2.5)

<ImageWithBg
  title="Payment redirect to Stripe"
  alt="Payment redirect to Stripe image"
  src="/static/images/flutter-marketplace-app-with-stripe-connect-part-2/payment-redirect-to-stripe.gif"
  caption="Figure 2.5"
  imageHeight={500}
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

Now let's see what happens if the user cancels the payment.
[Figure 2.6](#figure-2.6) shows that when the user cancels the payment, the
WebView is automatically closed and we see the toast message of cancellation.

<ImageWithBg
  title="Payment cancelled"
  alt="Payment cancelled image"
  src="/static/images/flutter-marketplace-app-with-stripe-connect-part-2/payment-cancelled.gif"
  caption="Figure 2.6"
  imageHeight={500}
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

Awesome!ðŸ˜„ Now let's talk about a successful payment. Note that our Seller
doesn't have any earnings so far as shown in [Figure 2.3](#figure-2.3). With a
successful payment, that should change eventually. [Figure 2.7](#figure-2.7)
shows what happens in a successful payment flow. Notice that you have to also
use a test card for testing the payment.

> Note: Stripe recommends using `4242-4242-4242-4242` as the card, **any future
> date**, and **any 3 digit CVC** for test payments. Similarly what we've used
> in Figure 2.7

<ImageWithBg
  title="Payment successful"
  alt="Payment successful image"
  src="/static/images/flutter-marketplace-app-with-stripe-connect-part-2/payment-successful.gif"
  caption="Figure 2.7"
  imageHeight={500}
  backgroundColor="transparent"
/>

Woohoo ðŸŽ‰! Our first successfuly payment for this Seller. If you go to your
Stripe Dashboard and have a look at the Seller account, you should see the
balance increased as shown in [Figure 2.8](#figure-2.8).

<ImageWithBg
  title="Seller has balance"

## Conclusion

Phew! I know this was a looong tutorial. But trust me, it took me more time to
plan and write it than what it took for you to follow ðŸ˜„. And I hope you enjoyed
it as much as I enjoyed making it. In this tutorial we learnt how to implement
deep links with Flutter's Navigation 2.0. We also learnt how to use a WebView
using the `webview_flutter` package along with the Stripe Web (Javascript) SDK
to implement the Checkout flow. There are a lot of other hidden gems in the code
that you can explore yourself and might be covered in the Video Tutorial as
well. Don't forget to share this article within your circle so more people can
learn how to work with Flutter and Stripe Connect. And as always, stay safe,
stay healthy, and Happy Coding! ðŸŽ‰
