## Why

If you've a blog or website where you share your thoughts, tutorials, or
articles etc, it is most likely that your intent is to share knowledge or your
thoughts with an audience and you'd want to get their feedback on what you
share. For that, implementing comments on your posts is a really good idea to
gather feedback. Now, there are many ways to do that. But if you're a developer,
or your audience is mainly folks who might have an account on GitHub, this
article is for you.

## Let's do it!

### Creating the GatsbyJS Blog project

We'll begin with creating a new project in our local machine. I'm supposing that
you being a developer already has NodeJS installed in your machine. We'll start
with creating a gatsbyjs project using the blog starter.

Choose a folder in your machine where you'd want to create this project, then
run the following command in your command prompt/terminal after navigating to
the folder:

```bash
npx gatsby new blog-with-comments https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
```

Now navigate to the folder and start the development server by using the
following commands:

```bash
cd blog-with-comments

npm run develop
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and you should now
see the app working as follows:

<ImageWithBg
  title="Gatsby Starter Blog"
  alt="Gatsby Starter Blog image"
  src="/static/images/adding-comments-to-your-gatsbyjs-blog/gatsby-starter-blog.png"
/>

### Creating the GitHub repository for the project

Go to your GitHub account and create a new repository as follows:

<ImageWithBg
  title="Gatsby Starter Blog"
  alt="Gatsby Starter Blog image"
  src="/static/images/adding-comments-to-your-gatsbyjs-blog/new-repository.png"
/>

No need to create any Readme or license file when you create this repository.
Once done, go back to your project and add the new repository's origin to your
git remote as follows:

```bash
git remote add origin <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
```

Then push your code to your repository as follows:

```bash
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
git push -u origin main
```

### Installing the Utterances app for the GitHub repository

Now install the [Utterances app](https://github.com/apps/utterances) into your
newly created repository. I'd suggest using the "Only select repositories"
option and specifically selecting your target repository within your GitHub
space.

### Implementing the _Comments_ component to use the Utterances app

Once done, open the GatsbyJs project in your favorite editor. I personally use
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) these days. Create a new file under the
`src/components` folder named `Comments.js` and add the following code to it:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'
const Comments = ({ issueTerm }) => {
  const commentsUUID = `comments_${issueTerm}`
  useEffect(() => {
    let anchor
    const theme = 'github-light' // you could choose other themes too
    const script = document.createElement('script')
    anchor = document.getElementById(commentsUUID)
    script.setAttribute('src', 'https://utteranc.es/client.js')
    script.setAttribute('crossorigin', 'anonymous')
    script.setAttribute('async', true)
    script.setAttribute('repo', 'YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME')
    script.setAttribute('issue-term', issueTerm)
    script.setAttribute('theme', theme)
    anchor.appendChild(script)
    return () => {
      anchor.innerHTML = ''
    }
  })
  return (
    <>
      <div id={commentsUUID} className="post-comments" className="relative">
        <div className="utterances-frame"></div>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

export default Comments
```

Make sure to put the correct github username and the github repository as
specified in the code above. Once done, add the `Comments` component in the
`src/templates/blog-post.js` file as follows:

```js {7,33,86-88}
import * as React from 'react'
import { Link, graphql } from 'gatsby'

import Bio from '../components/bio'
import Layout from '../components/layout'
import Seo from '../components/seo'
import Comments from '../components/Comments'

const BlogPostTemplate = ({ data, location }) => {
  const post = data.markdownRemark
  const siteTitle = data.site.siteMetadata?.title || `Title`
  const { previous, next } = data

  return (
    <Layout location={location} title={siteTitle}>
      <Seo
        title={post.frontmatter.title}
        description={post.frontmatter.description || post.excerpt}
      />
      <article className="blog-post" itemScope itemType="http://schema.org/Article">
        <header>
          <h1 itemProp="headline">{post.frontmatter.title}</h1>
          <p>{post.frontmatter.date}</p>
        </header>
        <section dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.html }} itemProp="articleBody" />
        <Comments issueTerm={post.fields.slug} />
        <hr />
        <footer>
          <Bio />
        </footer>
      </article>
      <nav className="blog-post-nav">
        <ul className="flex flex-wrape space-between p-0">
          <li>
            {previous && (
              <Link to={previous.fields.slug} rel="prev">
                ‚Üê {previous.frontmatter.title}
              </Link>
            )}
          </li>
          <li>
            {next && (
              <Link to={next.fields.slug} rel="next">
                {next.frontmatter.title} ‚Üí
              </Link>
            )}
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default BlogPostTemplate

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query BlogPostBySlug(
    $id: String!
    $previousPostId: String
    $nextPostId: String
  ) {
    site {
      siteMetadata {
        title
      }
    }
    markdownRemark(id: { eq: $id }) {
      id
      excerpt(pruneLength: 160)
      html
      fields {
        slug
      }
      frontmatter {
        title
        date(formatString: "MMMM DD, YYYY")
        description
      }
    }
    previous: markdownRemark(id: { eq: $previousPostId }) {...}
    next: markdownRemark(id: { eq: $nextPostId }) {...}
  }
`
```

Now navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and click on any
blog post. Scroll down and at the bottom, you should be able to see the comments
widget as follows:

<ImageWithBg
  title="Comments widget"
  alt="Comments widget image"
  src="/static/images/adding-comments-to-your-gatsbyjs-blog/comments-added.png"
/>

And boom! üòÑ You now have the capability to add comments to all your blog posts.
Click the "Sign in with GitHub" button and try adding a comment. What's great is
that the comment box supports markdown. Which means people can also add code
snippets to their comments using the syntax highlighting etc.

<ImageWithBg
  title="Sample comment"
  alt="CSample comment image"
  src="/static/images/adding-comments-to-your-gatsbyjs-blog/sample-comment.png"
/>

What's amazing is that the Utterances app will automatically generate a new
GitHub issue for each post someone comments on.

<ImageWithBg
  title="GitHib Issue created for comments"
  alt="GitHib Issue created for comments image"
  src="/static/images/adding-comments-to-your-gatsbyjs-blog/issue-created-for-comments.png"
/>

And if you wanted to moderate the comments, you can simply go to the GitHub
issue and do that.

## Conclusion

I found the [Utterances app](https://utteranc.es/) quite handy as I've been
thinking about the easiest way to add comments to my blog for the developer
community. I could go with creating my own comments and likes system using
something like Firebase. But that's just too much work and I'd rather spend my
time creating more content for you folks than re-inventing the wheel when there
are already amazing and open-source solutions available like this.
