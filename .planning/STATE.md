# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-02)

**Core value:** Community members can find mentors, collaborate on real projects with structured support, and follow clear learning roadmaps—all within a mentor-led, quality-focused environment.
**Current milestone:** v2.0 Community Collaboration & Learning

## Current Position

Milestone: v2.0
Phase: 4 of 10 (Foundation & Permissions)
Plan: 2 of 3
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-02 — Completed 04-02-PLAN.md (Security rules and validation utilities)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 37% (7/19 total plans complete across all milestones)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7 (v1.0: 5, v2.0: 2)
- Average duration: ~33 min
- Total execution time: ~4 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2 | 178 min | 89 min |
| 02 | 2 | ~60 min | ~30 min |
| 03 | 1 | 2 min | 2 min |
| 04 | 2 | 4 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-02 (~55min), 03-01 (2min), 04-01 (2min), 04-02 (2min)
- Trend: Foundation/infrastructure tasks execute very quickly when dependencies installed; straightforward security rules and validation utilities are fast

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Decision | Phase | Context |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Extend existing admin tabs vs new tab | v1.0 | Extended All Mentors/Mentees tabs - reuse layout, consistent UX |
| Filter modal vs toggle for declined | v1.0 | Comprehensive filter modal - better UX, prevents pagination issues |
| State machine for status transitions | v1.0 | ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS map prevents invalid status changes |
| Composite keys for edit state | v1.0 | Prevents multi-instance edit jumps when same user in multiple cards |
| Batch fetching (30-item chunks) | v1.0 | Firestore 'in' query limit workaround |
| Phase structure follows research | v2.0 | Foundation → Projects (Core → Team → Demo) → Roadmaps (Create → Discover) → Integration |
| Security rules helper functions | 04-02 | isSignedIn(), isAdmin(), isAcceptedMentor() reduce duplication in Firestore rules |
| Two sanitization functions | 04-02 | sanitizeMarkdown (HTML) and sanitizeMarkdownRaw (Markdown storage) for flexibility |
| Strict HTTPS for GitHub URLs | 04-02 | Require https:// protocol only, reject http:// for security |
| Immutable version history | 04-02 | Roadmap versions subcollection has no update/delete for audit trail |

### Pending Todos

### Workflow Notes

**Quick task + PR workflow:**
For GitHub issue fixes, use `/gsd:quick` to plan and execute, then:
1. Checkout `main`, pull latest, create a `fix/<issue>-<slug>` branch
2. Cherry-pick the implementation commits (not docs commits) onto the new branch
3. `git rebase main`
4. Push and `gh pr create --base main` with "Closes #NNN" in the body
5. Update STATE.md with the quick task record

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 4 Readiness:**
- Need to verify existing Discord service rate limiting handles combined mentorship + project channel creation
- ✅ Firestore security rules prevent permission escalation (PERM-01 through PERM-04 enforced)
- ✅ Type definitions extended without breaking existing mentorship imports

**Phase 5 Readiness:**
- Discord category strategy needs validation (separate "Projects - Active" vs "Mentorship YYYY-MM" categories)
- Channel limit monitoring system required before enabling project channel creation at scale

**Phase 8 Readiness:**
- Firebase Storage integration pattern for Markdown content needs architecture research (version conflicts with concurrent edits)
