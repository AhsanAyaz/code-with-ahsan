# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-11)

**Core value:** Community members can find mentors, collaborate on real projects with structured support, and follow clear learning roadmaps—all within a mentor-led, quality-focused environment.
**Current focus:** v4.0 milestone archived — ready for next milestone

## Current Position

v4.0 complete. No active milestone.

## Performance Metrics

**v4.0 Velocity:**
- 2 plans completed across 1 phase
- 15 commits, 246 files changed, +11,603/-3,459 LOC
- Total execution: 7 days (2026-03-04 → 2026-03-11)

**v3.0 Reference:**
- 8 plans completed across 4 phases
- 46 commits, 181 files changed, +5,700/-564 LOC
- Total execution: 1 day (2026-03-10)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
- [Phase 01]: Used top-level import for HackathonTwist in constants.ts for cleaner type annotation
- [Phase 01]: Winners GET API is publicly accessible to allow public display panel to read without credentials
- [Phase 01-03]: Admin form uses PLACEMENTS config array to DRY up 3 placement sections; WinnersDisplay returns null until announcedAt confirmed
- [Phase 01]: HostAuthGate imports only ADMIN_TOKEN_KEY from AdminAuthGate — token-only auth with no Firebase user dependency
- [Phase 01]: TwistRevealSection owns its countdown internally via setInterval in useRef — parent HostPanel only flips twistPhase state
- [Phase 01]: WinnersSection uses prevRevealedCount ref to detect 2->3 transition for confetti (prevents double-fire)
- [Phase quick-260410]: Used text-based social proof strip and single DaisyUI collapse for a la carte markdown

### Workflow Notes

**Cron jobs — always use GitHub Actions + scripts/:**
Scheduled tasks use `.github/workflows/*.yml` running `npx tsx scripts/*.ts`. Do NOT use Vercel cron or Next.js API routes for scheduled work.

**Quick task + PR workflow:**
For GitHub issue fixes, use `/gsd:quick` to plan and execute, then cherry-pick onto a fix branch and create PR with "Closes #NNN".

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 1 added: Promptathon live host panel with presenter slides, admin winner management, and permanent winners display
- Phase 2 added: ADK Community Assistant for Discord (Google Cloud Next 2026 demo)

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
