# Quick Task: Refine Roadmap Actions Dropdown Style

## Goal
Improve the visual consistency of the roadmap actions dropdown by matching its background color to the main header's dropdown menu.

## Tasks
- [x] **Darken Dropdown Background**: Changed the background class of the `RoadmapActionsDropdown` menu from `bg-base-100` to `bg-base-300`.

## UX Improvements
- **Visual Consistency**: The dropdown now matches the styling of other overlay menus in the application (like the Community dropdown), providing a more cohesive look and better contrast against card backgrounds.
