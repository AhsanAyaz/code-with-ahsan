# Quick Task: Improve Dashboard UI - Quick Links and Discord Buttons

## Goal
Improve the dashboard UI/UX by reducing congestion in the Quick Links section and updating mentorship communication links to point to Discord channels instead of direct messages.

## Tasks
- [x] Update `QuickLinksWidget.tsx` to use a 3-column layout max to reduce visual density.
- [x] Update `ActiveMatchesWidget.tsx` to replace the "Message" link with a "Channel" link that opens the mentorship's Discord channel.
- [x] Add Discord icon to the "Channel" button for better visual recognition.

## Verification
- [ ] Verify Quick Links layout on different screen sizes.
- [ ] Verify "Channel" button appears and links correctly for active mentorships.
