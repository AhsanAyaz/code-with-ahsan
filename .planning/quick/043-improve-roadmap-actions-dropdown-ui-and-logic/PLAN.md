# Quick Task: Improve Roadmap Actions Dropdown UI and Logic

## Goal
Refine the `RoadmapActionsDropdown` component to provide a better user experience by hiding redundant actions and improving visual spacing.

## Tasks
- [x] **Conditional Visibility**: Hide the "Preview" button when the user is already on the roadmap detail page to reduce redundancy.
- [x] **Visual Spacing**: Added `gap-2` and `flex` alignment to dropdown menu items to provide consistent padding between icons/emojis and labels.

## UX Improvements
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Users aren't presented with a link to the page they are currently viewing.
- **Improved Scannability**: Better spacing between icons and text makes the menu easier to read.
