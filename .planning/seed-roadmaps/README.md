# Seed Roadmaps for Code With Ahsan

Generated from NotebookLM notebook: "2026 Roadmap for AI-Native Software Development and Engineering Skills"

## Overview

These 8 roadmaps represent the complete 2026 learning curriculum covering modern software development and AI engineering skills.

## Roadmaps Created

| # | Domain | Difficulty | Est. Hours | File |
|---|--------|------------|------------|------|
| 1 | Web Development | Beginner-Advanced | 400-600 | 01-web-development-2026.md |
| 2 | Frontend Development | Intermediate-Advanced | 500 | 02-frontend-development-2026.md |
| 3 | Prompt Engineering | Beginner-Advanced | 100-150 | 03-prompt-engineering-2026.md |
| 4 | AI (Artificial Intelligence) | Intermediate-Advanced | 600 | 04-ai-artificial-intelligence-2026.md |
| 5 | Backend Development | Beginner-Advanced | 600-800 | 05-backend-development-2026.md |
| 6 | Machine Learning | Advanced | 1000+ | 06-machine-learning-2026.md |
| 7 | MCP (Model Context Protocol) | Intermediate | 50-100 | 07-mcp-model-context-protocol-2026.md |
| 8 | AI Agents | Advanced | 200-300 | 08-ai-agents-2026.md |

## Domain Mapping

These roadmaps map to the system's 8 domain categories:

- **web-dev** → Web Development
- **frontend** → Frontend Development
- **backend** → Backend Development
- **ml** → Machine Learning
- **ai** → AI (Artificial Intelligence)
- **mcp-servers** → MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- **ai-agents** → AI Agents
- **prompt-engineering** → Prompt Engineering

## Next Steps: Upload to System

### Option A: Manual Upload (Recommended for first batch)

1. **Navigate** to `/roadmaps/new` (requires mentor login)

2. **For each roadmap:**
   - Copy the Markdown content
   - Fill in the form:
     - Title: Use domain name (e.g., "Web Development 2026")
     - Description: First paragraph of content
     - Domain: Select matching category
     - Difficulty: Based on content (see table above)
     - Estimated Hours: From table above
     - Content: Paste full Markdown
   - Save as Draft OR Submit for Review

3. **Admin Approval:**
   - Navigate to `/mentorship/admin`
   - Go to "Roadmaps" tab
   - Review and approve each roadmap

### Option B: Programmatic Upload (Future Enhancement)

Create a script to POST to `/api/roadmaps` with authentication:
- Would require admin/mentor auth token
- Batch upload all 8 roadmaps
- Auto-submit for review

## Content Quality

Each roadmap includes:
- ✅ Clear learning progression (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced)
- ✅ Specific technologies and frameworks
- ✅ Hour estimates and timelines
- ✅ Concrete project milestones
- ✅ Best practices and anti-patterns
- ✅ 2026-specific trends (AI-native, resumability, etc.)
- ✅ Tool recommendations
- ✅ Success criteria

## Source

All content researched and synthesized from NotebookLM notebook (35 sources):
- 2026 technology trends
- Industry best practices
- Learning progressions
- Real-world project examples
