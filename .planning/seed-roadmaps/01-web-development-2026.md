# Web Development 2026: AI-Native Systems & Performance

In 2026, web development has evolved from static page rendering to building **intelligent systems** where AI is core infrastructure. The focus is on performance (Core Web Vitals/INP), accessibility as a legal mandate, and edge computing.

## Key Trends & Focus Areas

### 🤖 AI-Native Architecture
Integrate AI decision layers directly into app logic rather than just adding chatbots. AI becomes infrastructure, not a feature.

### ⚡ Performance-First Mandate
- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)** optimization
- Edge computing for lower latency
- 100/100 Core Web Vitals score as standard

### ♿ Mandatory Accessibility
- European Accessibility Act (EAA) compliance
- Inclusive design by default
- WCAG 2.1 AA minimum standard

### 📱 Progressive Web Apps (PWA) Maturity
PWAs as primary mobile strategy with:
- Offline-first architecture
- Push notifications
- App-like experiences

## Essential Technologies

### Core Languages
- **HTML5** - Semantic markup
- **CSS** - Container Queries, Native Nesting, CSS Grid/Flexbox
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Modern ES2024+ features

### Runtimes & Edge
- **Node.js** - Build tooling and server-side
- **Edge Runtimes** - Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions
- **Deno/Bun** - Modern JavaScript runtimes

### Build Tools
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast dev server
- **Turbopack** - Next-gen bundler

### AI Integration
- **Vibe Coding Tools** - Bolt.new, Lovable, v0 for rapid scaffolding
- **AI Code Assistants** - GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor

## Learning Path

### 🟢 Beginner (0-150 hours)

**Fundamentals**
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts
- JavaScript fundamentals (variables, functions, arrays, objects)
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Fetch API and async/await

**First Project**
Build a personal portfolio website with:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Responsive CSS layout
- Basic JavaScript interactivity
- Contact form with validation

**AI Integration**
- Use AI coding assistants for explanation and boilerplate
- Learn to write effective prompts for code generation
- Understand when to trust vs. verify AI suggestions

### 🟡 Intermediate (150-350 hours)

**Advanced Technologies**
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better DX
- **Progressive Web Apps** - Service Workers, offline support
- **Edge Computing** - Deploy logic closer to users
- **Accessibility** - ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, screen reader testing

**Performance Optimization**
- Lighthouse audits and Core Web Vitals
- Image optimization (WebP, AVIF)
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Caching strategies

**Second Project**
Create an offline-capable PWA e-commerce store with:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Service Worker for offline functionality
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- 90+ Lighthouse performance score

### 🔴 Advanced (350-600 hours)

**System Architecture**
- **Distributed Systems** - Edge computing patterns
- **WebAssembly (Wasm)** - High-performance modules
- **Micro-frontends** - Scalable architecture
- **Performance Budgets** - Automated monitoring

**AI-Native Development**
- Integrate LLMs into application logic
- Build context-aware user experiences
- Implement intelligent error handling
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) in web apps

**Capstone Project**
Build a production-grade application with:
- 100/100 Core Web Vitals score
- Edge-native architecture
- Full PWA capabilities
- AI-powered features (search, recommendations)
- Enterprise-grade accessibility

## Critical Milestones

## Time Investment

**Total Estimated Hours**: 400-600 hours
**Timeline**: 6-12 months (part-time), 3-6 months (full-time)

## Tools & Resources

### Development Environment
- **Editor**: VS Code with AI extensions
- **Browser**: Chrome DevTools / Firefox Dev Edition
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

### Testing & Validation
- Lighthouse for performance
- axe DevTools for accessibility
- WebPageTest for real-world testing

### Learning Platforms
