<objective>
Build all API routes for team formation: applications (submit, list, approve, decline), invitations (create, list, accept, decline), and member removal.

Purpose: Enable the complete team management workflow through REST API endpoints that the frontend will consume.
Output: 5 new API route files handling the full application/invitation/member lifecycle.
</objective>

  <action>
Follow the patterns from the Phase 6 research exactly. All routes use Next.js 16 async params pattern: `{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }`.

**1. POST /api/projects/[id]/applications** (Developer applies to project)
- Validate required fields: userId, message
- Fetch project document, return 404 if not found
- Fetch user profile from mentorship_profiles
- Check `canApplyToProject` permission (from src/lib/permissions.ts)
- Check project status is "active" (only active projects accept applications)
- Composite key: `${projectId}_${userId}` - check existence, return 409 if duplicate
- Create application document in `project_applications` collection with denormalized userProfile
- Update project `lastActivityAt`
- Return 201 with applicationId

**2. GET /api/projects/[id]/applications** (Creator lists applications)
- Accept query param `status` (optional, defaults to all)
- Query `project_applications` where projectId matches, optionally filtered by status
- Return applications array sorted by createdAt desc

**3. PUT /api/projects/[id]/applications/[userId]** (Creator approves/declines)
- Accept `{ action: "approve" | "decline", feedback?: string }` body
- Composite key: `${projectId}_${userId}` to find application
- Return 404 if not found

On **approve**:
- Use Firestore batch write for atomicity:
  1. Update application status to "approved", set approvedAt
  2. Create project_members document with composite key `${projectId}_${userId}`, role "member", denormalized userProfile
  3. Update project lastActivityAt
- After batch commit: Add to Discord channel (non-blocking) using `addMemberToChannel` if project has discordChannelId and user has discordUsername in mentorship_profiles

On **decline**:
- Update application status to "declined", set declinedAt, set feedback if provided

**4. POST /api/projects/[id]/invitations** (Creator invites by email or Discord)
- Accept `{ invitedBy, email?, discordUsername? }` - must provide email OR discordUsername
- Look up user: by email query on mentorship_profiles, or by discordUsername query
- Return 404 with helpful message if user not found ("No user found with that email. They must create a profile first.")
- Check if already a team member (project_members composite key), return 409
- Check if invitation already sent (project_invitations composite key), return 409
- Create invitation document with composite key `${projectId}_${userId}`, denormalized userProfile
- Update project lastActivityAt
- Return 201 with invitationId

**5. GET /api/projects/[id]/invitations** (List invitations)
- Query `project_invitations` where projectId matches
- Return invitations array

**6. PUT /api/projects/[id]/invitations/[userId]** (Accept/decline invitation)
- Accept `{ action: "accept" | "decline" }` body
- Composite key: `${projectId}_${userId}` to find invitation

On **accept**:
- Firestore batch write:
  1. Update invitation status to "accepted", set acceptedAt
  2. Create project_members document (same pattern as application approval)
  3. Update project lastActivityAt
- Non-blocking: Add to Discord channel

On **decline**:
- Update invitation status to "declined", set declinedAt

Follow existing API patterns from src/app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts for error handling, JSON response shapes, and import patterns. Use `db` from `@/lib/firebaseAdmin` and `FieldValue` from `firebase-admin/firestore`.

- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
- `npm run build` passes
- All 4 route files exist with correct exports
  </verify>
  <done>
- POST /api/projects/[id]/applications creates application with composite key, validates canApplyToProject
- PUT /api/projects/[id]/applications/[userId] approve creates member + adds Discord, decline saves feedback
- POST /api/projects/[id]/invitations finds user by email/Discord, prevents duplicates
- PUT /api/projects/[id]/invitations/[userId] accept creates member + adds Discord
- All endpoints update lastActivityAt

  <name>Task 2: Create member removal endpoint</name>
  <files>src/app/api/projects/[id]/members/[memberId]/route.ts</files>
  <action>
**DELETE /api/projects/[id]/members/[memberId]** (TEAM-09: Remove team member)
- `memberId` is the userId of the member to remove
- Fetch project, verify requestor is project creator or admin (use `canManageProjectMembers` from permissions.ts)
- Composite key for member document: `${projectId}_${memberId}`
- Return 404 if member not found
- Firestore batch:
  1. Delete project_members document
  2. Update project lastActivityAt
- Non-blocking: Remove from Discord channel using `removeMemberFromChannel` if project has discordChannelId and member has discordUsername
- Return 200 with success message

Follow Next.js 16 async params: `{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string; memberId: string }> }`

- `npm run build` passes
- Route file exists at src/app/api/projects/[id]/members/[memberId]/route.ts
  </verify>
  <done>
- DELETE /api/projects/[id]/members/[memberId] removes member from Firestore and Discord channel
- Permission check via canManageProjectMembers (only creator or admin)
- Non-blocking Discord removal follows existing pattern
  </done>
</task>

<verification>
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
- `npm run build` succeeds
- All 5 route files exist and export correct HTTP methods
- API patterns consistent with existing src/app/api/projects/ routes (error handling, response shapes)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Complete application lifecycle: submit (POST) -> list (GET) -> approve/decline (PUT)
- Complete invitation lifecycle: create (POST) -> list (GET) -> accept/decline (PUT)
- Member removal with Discord channel sync
- Composite keys prevent duplicate applications and invitations
- Batch writes ensure atomicity for approval/acceptance operations
- Discord operations are non-blocking (failures logged but don't block API response)
- No regressions (build passes)
