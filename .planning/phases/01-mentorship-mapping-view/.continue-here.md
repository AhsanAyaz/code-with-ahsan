<current_state>
Executing Phase 1, Plan 02 (UI Enhancement). Tasks 1 & 2 are complete and committed.
Task 3 is a human verification checkpoint. User initially reported the UI worked but showed
"0 mentors and 0 mentees everywhere" - a data issue. Bug was found and fixed (wrong Firestore
collection name). Fix is committed. Awaiting user re-verification that relationships now display correctly.

<remaining_work>

**Plan 01-02:**
- Task 3: User needs to verify the fix works (relationships display correctly)
- After approval: Create 01-02-SUMMARY.md

**After Plan 01-02 completes:**
- Run gsd-verifier to check phase goal achievement
- Update ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, REQUIREMENTS.md
- Commit phase completion

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- **Bug fix**: Changed Firestore collection from `mentorship_matches` to `mentorship_sessions`
  - Root cause: Plan specified wrong collection name
  - Verified `mentorship_sessions` has 106 documents with the expected data structure

</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - just needs user verification that the fix works
</blockers>

<context>
Phase 1 implements MAP-01 and MAP-02 requirements (view mentors with mentees, view mentees with mentors).
The API endpoint and UI are fully built. The only issue was a wrong collection name in the API route.
After user approves, we complete the plan with SUMMARY.md, then run the verifier to confirm phase goal
is achieved, then offer next steps (Phase 2: Discord & Status Management).
</context>

<next_action>
1. Ask user to verify the fix: navigate to /mentorship/admin, check All Mentors/All Mentees tabs
2. If approved: spawn continuation agent to create SUMMARY.md
3. If issues: investigate and fix
4. After plan complete: run gsd-verifier, update roadmap, offer next phase
</next_action>

<checkpoint_context>
The checkpoint was asking user to verify:
1. Summary stats show real numbers (not 0)
2. Mentor cards show actual mentee counts
3. Expandable sections show partner profiles with status badges, Discord links, dates
4. All Mentees tab works similarly
5. Search and pagination work

User should re-test after the collection name fix (commit 25b4635).
