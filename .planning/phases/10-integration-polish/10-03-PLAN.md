# Phase 10 Plan: Integration & Polish - Regression & Polish

## Goal
Verify all new integrations and ensure system stability.

## Tasks

### 1. Regression Testing (Manual Check)

- [ ] **Project Detail**: Verify `RecommendedRoadmapsWidget` logic.
- [ ] **Roadmap Detail**: Verify `RelatedProjectsWidget` logic.
- [ ] **APIs**: Review `GET /api/projects` and `GET /api/roadmaps` changes for potential regressions.

### 2. Polish
- [ ] **Loading States**: Ensure all new widgets handle loading gracefully.
- [ ] **Empty States**: Verify empty states for widgets are user-friendly.
