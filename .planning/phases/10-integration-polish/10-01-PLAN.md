# Phase 10 Plan: Integration & Polish - Dashboard Integration

## Goal
Integrate Projects and Roadmaps into the Mentorship Dashboard using the new widget-based architecture.

## Tasks

### 1. Project Integration
- [ ] **Create `MyProjectsWidget`**:
    - Fetch projects where user is owner (`creatorId`) or member (`member`).
    - Display cards with project title, role (Owner/Member), and status.
    - Link to project detail page.
- [ ] **Update Dashboard Page**:
    - Add data fetching for projects in `DashboardContent`.

### 2. Roadmap Integration (Mentors Only)
- [ ] **Create `MyRoadmapsWidget`**:
    - Fetch roadmaps created by the mentor (`creatorId`).
    - Display title, domain, and status (Draft, Pending, Approved).
    - Link to roadmap detail/edit page.
- [ ] **Update Dashboard Page**:
    - Add data fetching for roadmaps in `DashboardContent`.

### 3. Layout Refinement
- [ ] **Arrange Widgets**:
    - Place `MyProjectsWidget` in the main column.
    - Place `MyRoadmapsWidget` in the main column (if mentor).
    - Ensure responsive layout handles the increased number of widgets.
