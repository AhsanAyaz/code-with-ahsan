# Phase 13 Plan: Mentor & Mentee Dashboard UX Review & Redesign

## Goal
Transform the current "Launchpad" dashboard (static grid of links) into a modern, actionable "Command Center" that surfaces critical information and tasks immediately, following 2026 UX standards.

## Context
- **Current State**: `src/app/mentorship/dashboard/page.tsx` renders a grid of equal-sized cards for navigation.
- **Pain Points**: Cluttered interface, buried critical actions (pending requests), lack of context ("What do I do now?").
- **Target State**: A widget-based layout with "Action Required", "Up Next", and "Active Mentorships" sections.
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI.

## Tasks

### 1. UX Analysis & Redesign Specification
- [ ] **Analyze Current Components**: Review `src/app/mentorship/dashboard/page.tsx`, `MentorshipRequestModal`, and related components.
- [ ] **Define "Command Center" Structure**: Draft a layout specification for the new dashboard.
    - **Header**: Welcome + Daily Briefing.
    - **Primary Zone**: "Action Required" (Pending Requests/Invitations).
    - **Secondary Zone**: "My Mentorships" (Active Matches in Bento Grid).
    - **Tertiary Zone**: "Progress" (Goals/Roadmaps).
    - **Quaternary Zone**: "Discovery" (Community/Browse).
- [ ] **Create Component Specifications**: Define props/state for `ActionRequiredWidget`, `ActiveMentorshipsWidget`, `ProgressWidget`.

### 2. Implementation: Core Widgets
- [ ] **Create `ActionRequiredWidget`**:
    - Display pending requests/invitations prominently.
    - Include inline "Approve/Decline" actions (Optimistic UI).
- [ ] **Create `ActiveMentorshipsWidget`**:
    - Display active matches in a responsive list/grid.
    - Show "Next Session" details if available.
- [ ] **Create `ProgressWidget`**:
    - Visualize goal completion or roadmap progress (using mock data if API unavailable).

### 3. Dashboard Refactor
- [ ] **Create `NewDashboardLayout`**: Implement the grid structure using CSS Grid/Flexbox.
- [ ] **Replace Existing Grid**: Swap the old card grid with the new widget-based layout in `page.tsx`.
- [ ] **Migrate Navigation Links**: Move static links (Browse, Community, Settings) to a sidebar or a "Quick Links" footer section to reduce noise.

### 4. Verification
- [ ] **Visual Check**: Ensure responsiveness on mobile/desktop.
- [ ] **Functional Check**: Verify actions (Approve/Decline) work from new widgets.
- [ ] **UX Audit**: Confirm "Command Center" goals are met (immediate actionability).

## Deliverables
- [ ] `ANALYSIS.md` (UX Review Report).
- [ ] `REDESIGN_SPEC.md` (Technical Design).
- [ ] Updated `src/app/mentorship/dashboard/page.tsx`.
- [ ] New components in `src/components/dashboard/*`.
